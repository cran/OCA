 Haircut Allocation Principle  
}
\description{
   Capital allocation based on the Haircut Allocation Principle.
}
\usage{
hap(Loss, Capital, alpha = 0.95, 
     model = "normal", df = NULL)
}


\arguments{
  \item{Loss}{
  Either a scalar or a vector of size \emph{N} containing the mean losses.
}
  \item{Capital}{
  A scalar representing the capital to be allocated to each loss.
}
  \item{alpha}{
  A numeric value (either a single one or a vector) consisting of the significance level at which ES has to be computed, it can either be a single numeric value or a vector of numeric values.
}
  \item{model}{
 A character string indicating which distribution is to be used for computing the VaR underlying the Haircut Allocation Principle (HAP), the default value is the \code{normal} distribution, the other alternative is \code{t-student} distribution with \eqn{\upsilon}{\upsilon} degrees of freedom. When \code{model='both'} \code{'normal'} as well as \code{'t-student'} are used when computing the HAP, see examples.
}
  \item{df}{
    An integer indicating the degrees of freedom for the t-student distribution when setting \code{model='t-student'} and \code{model='both'}. \code{df} must be greater than 2. 
}
}
\details{
 This function computes the capital allocation based on the so-called Haircut Allocation Principle whose expression is as follows:
 
 \deqn{
   K_{i} = \frac{K}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} F_{X_{j}}^{-1}(p)} F_{X_{i}}^{-1}(p) 
 }{
 K_{i} ={K}/{\sum_{j=1}^{n} F_{X_{j}}^{-1}(p)} F_{X_{i}}^{-1}(p) 
 }
 
 
 For \eqn{i=1, \ldots, n}{i=1,...,n}, where \eqn{K_{i}}{K_i} represents the optimal capital to be allocated to each individual loss for the \emph{i}-th business unit, \emph{K} is the total capital to be allocated, \eqn{F_{X_{i}}^{-1}(p)}{F_{X_{i}}^{-1}(p)} is the quantile function (VaR) for the \emph{i}-th loss.
}
\value{
A real-valued \eqn{n \times 1}{n x 1} matrix containing the optimal capital allocation, if \code{Capital} is set to 1, then the returned matrix will consist of the proportions of capital each individual loss needs to be optimally faced.
